### Python_Casual_Inference

1. Workout of building a structure model by identifying the focal variable x and testing its robustness by applying the relevant tests.

This work is using the stroke prediction dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) - According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths, we use the dataset found from Kaggle for this the project, which is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
